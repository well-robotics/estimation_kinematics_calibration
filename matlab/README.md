# MATLAB implementation

A stage-structured Fatrop full-information estimator with an adjoint KKT
gradient. SQP--BFGS, Frank--Wolfe, and projected Adam share the same covariance
and kinematic calibration problem.

The example signals and precomputed kinematics use
[well-robotics/STRIDE](https://github.com/well-robotics/STRIDE/tree/main); see
the [STRIDE paper (arXiv:2407.02648)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02648).

| [`setup.m`](setup.m) | Local MATLAB and CasADi path setup |

## Run

MATLAB, Optimization Toolbox, and a CasADi build with Fatrop are required. Set
`CASADI_MATLAB_PATH` when CasADi is not already on the MATLAB path.

```matlab
cd matlab
calibration = run_calibration(Method="sqp", Horizon="demo");
```

`Method` also accepts `"frank-wolfe"` and `"adam"`; `Horizon="full"` uses the
complete stored trajectory.
